## Hi there 👋, I’m Gyamjo Sherpa

I’m a **Software Developer** passionate about building applications that solve real-world problems and make life easier for people.  
I recently graduated with a **Bachelor's in Computer Science from Queens College**, and I’ve had the opportunity to work in both **private** and **government** sectors, contributing to meaningful projects that made a real impact.

I love seeing my code come to life in real-world use — whether it’s modernizing legacy systems, creating interactive user experiences, or developing intelligent solutions with AI and machine learning.
